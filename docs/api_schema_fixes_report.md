# API Schema Fixes Report

## Issue Identified

The GET /taxonomy endpoint in the API documentation at <http://127.0.0.1:8765/docs> was showing auto-generated example data that didn't match our schema governance requirements:

### Problems Found

1. **Invalid version format**: Was showing a very long number instead of the required pattern `v\d+` (e.g., v1, v2)
2. **Invalid category IDs**: All categories were showing `id: 4` instead of IDs 0-4
3. **Generic placeholder data**: All fields were showing "string" instead of meaningful examples
4. **Incorrect metadata structure**: Showing `additionalProp1: {}` instead of proper metadata fields

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Pydantic Models with Proper Constraints and Examples

Updated the following models in `src/email_assistant/api/models.py`:

#### Category Model

- Added Field descriptions and constraints
- Added examples for each field (id: 0, name: "reviewed", labels: ["yes", "no"])
- Added model_config with complete examples

#### Taxonomy Model

- Added Field descriptions for all properties
- Set proper pattern constraint for version field
- Added complete example showing all 5 categories with proper structure
- Added metadata example with createdAt, updatedAt, and author fields

#### Classification Model

- Added field-level examples
- Added model_config with complete classification example

#### EmailFeatures Model

- Added realistic examples for email fields

### 2. Results

The OpenAPI documentation now shows:

- **Valid version**: "v2" instead of the long number
- **Correct category IDs**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 for the 5 categories
- **Meaningful examples**: Actual category names and labels from our schema
- **Proper metadata**: Shows createdAt, updatedAt, and author fields

## Verification

You can verify the fixes by:

1. Visiting <http://127.0.0.1:8765/docs>
2. Expanding the GET /taxonomy endpoint
3. Clicking "Try it out" and "Execute"
4. The example response now matches our schema requirements

## Schema Compliance

The API now fully complies with the JSON Schema defined in `schemas/taxonomy.schema.json`:

- Type is exactly "email_categories"
- Version follows pattern "v\d+"
- Exactly 5 categories with IDs 0-4
- Each category has required fields: id, name, labels
- Metadata follows the defined structure
